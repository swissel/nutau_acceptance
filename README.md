# README #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### Development Plan & Status ###

* Geometric Acceptance
> DONE
* Probability Distributions for Exiting Tau Leptons
> Last simulations of tau propagations in progress
> Last step is to reduce the outputs to probability density functions
* Tau Lepton Decay in the atmosphere
> Exponentially distributed lifetime
* TAUOLA treatment of tau ecay products in atmosphere
> Distribution of shower initiation depths X_0
> Energy distribution of decay products
> Energy distribution of showers 
* Radio Emission of Upgoing Air Showers (ZHAireS)
> Library (or parametrization) of pulses for various geometries
* Detector Simulations
> Optimization of operating bandwidths.
> Target gain needed for scientifically compelling observations.
