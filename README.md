# README #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### Development Plan & Status ###
1. Introduction
1. Geometric Acceptance
    * DONE
1. Probability Distributions for Exiting Tau Leptons
    * Last simulations of tau propagations in progress \n
    * Last step is to reduce the outputs to probability density functions
1. Tau Lepton Decay in the atmosphere
    * Exponentially distributed lifetime
1. TAUOLA treatment of tau ecay products in atmosphere
    * Distribution of shower initiation depths X_0
    * Energy distribution of decay products
    * Energy distribution of showers 
1. Radio Emission of Upgoing Air Showers (ZHAireS)
    * Library (or parametrization) of pulses for various geometries
1. Detector Simulations
    * Optimization of operating bandwidths.
    * Target gain needed for scientifically compelling observations.
1. Results & Conclusions
    * Optimal frequency band of observation
    * Acceptance for various detector altitudes.
    * Acceptance curves as a function of gain


### Future Improvements ###

1. Detector Model
    * Include reflection of galactic noise on water/soil surface
    * Account for imperfect impedance matching and non-uniform antenna impedance
    * Include non-isotropic gain
